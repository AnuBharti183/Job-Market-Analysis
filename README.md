# Job-Market-Analysis
## Project Title: Job Market Trends Analysis
### Objective
The primary objective of this project was to analyze current job market trends by utilizing structured SQL queries on a relational database of job listings. This analysis aimed to extract actionable insights about hiring patterns, job demands, top hiring locations, in-demand skills, and salary trends. The end goal was to translate raw data into meaningful business insights and visualize these through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

### Tools & Technologies Used
* SQL: Data Cleaning, Preparation, and Complex Analysis
* Power BI: Visualization and Dashboard Development

### Project Workflow
#### Data Collection
* Utilized a structured job dataset containing information on companies, job titles, locations, industries, required skills, experience levels, and offered salaries.

#### Data Cleaning & Preparation (SQL)
* Removed duplicates and null records
* Standardized formats (dates, locations, job titles)
* Merged necessary tables to create a clean analytical dataset suitable for reporting

#### Data Analysis (SQL)
* Identified hiring trends across industries and job roles
* Analyzed salary ranges across regions and experience levels
* Determined high-demand skills and certifications
* Examined trends in remote vs. on-site job postings

#### Visualization (Power BI)
* Designed a clean, industry-standard dashboard showcasing key findings
* Included KPIs, bar charts, and trend lines for clarity

### Insights & Findings
* Most jobs are posted in the US, followed by the UK and Germany.
* Senior roles earn up to 2.5x more than entry-level positions.
* Python, SQL, TensorFlow, and AWS are the most requested skills.
* Over 60% of jobs are fully remote or hybrid.
* Peak hiring periods are January–March and August–October

### Outcome & Impact
This project demonstrates my ability to:
* Clean and transform complex datasets using SQL
* Perform advanced analytical queries to derive insights
* Build clear, impactful dashboards using Power BI
* Provide actionable recommendations to business stakeholders
